# Luxury Makeup Brand Analysis – DSA210 Project

An analysis of luxury makeup brands’ social media engagement and estimated sales impact using real-world TikTok content and Python-powered data sources.

---

## Overview
This project examines the relationship between **social media engagement** and **estimated sales growth** for two leading luxury makeup brands which are — **YSL Beauty** and **Lancôme** — by manually collecting TikTok data and analyzing it through Python-based data science tools.

---

## Objectives
- Investigating whether **higher TikTok engagement (views, likes, comments)** translates to **greater sales growth**.
- Identify which brand has stronger performance across TikTok.
- Compare **engagement effectiveness** between YSL Beauty and Lancôme.

---

## Data Collection
- **32 TikTok videos were manually collected**, 16 per brand (YSL Beauty and Lancôme).
- Data covered the period between **January–April 2025**, with **4 videos per month per brand**.
- Each row included: **Date**, **Brand**, **Views**, **Likes**, **Comments**, **Caption**, **Video Type**, and **Why Selected**.
- The dataset was manually created by reviewing each brand’s official TikTok content(@yslbeauty & @lancome.official) and curated based on engagement variety, content diversity, and brand activity.

---

## Synthetic Data (AI-assisted)
Two key variables were **generated programmatically using Python and AI-supported logic**:

1. **Sentiment Analysis (`SENTIMENT`)**:
   - A **rule-based sentiment classifier** was applied to captions using Python.
   - Positive, Neutral, and Negative labels were assigned based on keyword matches (e.g., “love”, “obsessed”, “worst”, etc).

2. **Growth Rate Estimation (`GROWTH RATE (%)`)**:
   - A custom metric was created based on engagement score:
     
     Engagement Score= (Likes+Comments)/Views
​

   - A base score was modified depending on the sentiment, ranging from -5% to +15% estimated growth.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using **pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib**, several visual analyses were performed:

- **Average Growth Rate by Brand** – barplot comparing YSL vs Lancôme
- **Sentiment Distribution** – countplot of all video sentiments
- **Likes vs Growth Rate** – scatterplot showing linear correlation
- **Video Type vs Growth Rate** – barplot by content category

 All visual outputs are stored under: `visuals/`

---

## Hypothesis Testing
Conducted using `scipy.stats`:

1. **T-Test**:
   - Compared mean growth rates between YSL and Lancôme
   - **Result:** No statistically significant difference (p = 0.8978)

2. **Pearson Correlation**:
   - Examined relationship between Likes and Growth Rate
   - **Result:** Moderate positive correlation (r = 0.366, p = 0.043)

Code for hypothesis testing is included in the file: `code/analysis_with_hypothesis.py`

## Machine Learning Application

By strengthening the project, a **Machine Learning model** was applied to understand the relation between **TikTok engagement** and the **synthetic sales growth rates**.

### Method Applied: Linear Regression
**Linear Regression** was selected due to the goal of predicting a continuous target variable: `Growth Rate (%)`.

### Dataset Preparation
- The original TikTok dataset was **manually collected** from the brand accounts: `@yslbeauty` and `@lancome.official`.  
- The manually collected data firstly included **32 rows**, which were based on metrics such as views and likes.  
- To support Machine Learning modeling, the dataset was **extended to 70+ rows** using **AI-assisted synthetic data generation**. The newly added rows were generated by using a similar pattern structureure in the original data (e.g., scaling engagement metrics, diversifying sentiment and video type distributions).  
- All columns such as `Likes`, `Comments`, `Views`, `Sentiment`, and `Video Type` were **numerically encoded** to be compatible with the model.

### Features Used
- **VIEWS**: Total views of each video  
- **LIKES**: Like count  
- **COMMENTS**: Comment count  
- **SENTIMENT**: AI-labeled sentiment polarity (`-1`, `0`, `+1`)  
- **VIDEO TYPE**: TikTok content format

### Implementation of the Model
- The model was implemented in **Python** using `scikit-learn`.  
- Dataset was split using an **80/20 train-test ratio**.  
- Model training and evaluation were completed in the script `ml_analysis.py`.

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: `13.29`  
- **R² Score**: `0.096`  
- The R² value indicates a weak predictive power, which is expected due to the synthetic nature and limited volume of the dataset.

### Project Files
- `ml_analysis.py` – Contains all ML model logic and evaluations  
- `requirements.txt` – Lists required Python dependencies
- Data file: `Extended_TikTok_Data_With_Growth.xlsx`


## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scipy.stats
- openpyxl

---

## Final Insights
- TikTok engagement metrics alone are **not sufficient** to explain differences in sales growth across luxury brands
- **Sentiment and engagement quality (likes/comments ratio)** play a more critical role than volume alone
- Data-driven estimation and hypothesis testing enable clear differentiation between content effectiveness
- The machine learning application showed that **content type** and **sentiment** can influence estimated growth outcomes, even though it was applied on a limited dataset.
---

## Summary
This project showcases how **real-world social data** combined with **AI-supported feature engineering** and **Python-based analytics** can lead to actionable insights in digital marketing for luxury cosmetics brands.
